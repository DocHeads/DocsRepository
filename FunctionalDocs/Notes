Update the php.ini file upload size

To Do:
- Email users when document is submitted
- Submission Upload testing
- XML Configuration file and parsing - possibly just make a config class
- Admin Home page
- Standard Home page
- Creating new dept needs to make the corresponding uploads directory


Testing:
- text areas have spaces in the input already before even typing
- Invalid users panel - > only Validated? column should be editable
- Should an email go to the ADMIN users to remind them of a new user validation?
